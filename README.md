# CodeClause-Internship-Task-Heart-Risk-Assesement
This repository hosts a comprehensive Data Science project focused on developing a Stroke Risk Assessment System. The system utilizes machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest, to predict the likelihood of stroke based on input health metrics. This project was undertaken as part of my Data Science internship at CodeClause.

Key Features-                                                                                                                              
‣ Machine Learning Models: The project employs popular machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest to analyze and predict stroke risk.                                                                                                  
‣ Data Processing: Extensive data preprocessing techniques have been applied to clean, handle missing values, and scale/normalize input features for optimal model performance.                                                                                                           
‣ User Interface (UI): A user-friendly web-based UI has been implemented using Flask, allowing users to input their health metrics seamlessly.     
‣ Model Evaluation: Rigorous model evaluation metrics, including Accuracy provides a comprehensive understanding of model performance.
